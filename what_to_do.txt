Fixes!

1. /(drawer_stud)/_layout.tsx:

    disable both line in return statement:
        Drawer.Screen name="place"
        Drawer.Screen name="total_transaction"

2. /(drawer_stud)/index.tsx:
    Pop is annoying, customer have to click one more time which ruins experience, so i commented it out:
    in function handleSelect():
        Alert.alert('Shop Details', `You selected ${shopDetails.shop_name}.`);

things left:
    1. fix git clone issue (Done)
    2. make amount route more robust, right now there are lots of issue related with staled state
    3. Implement transaction history route
