Fixes!

1. /(drawer_stud)/_layout.tsx:

    disable both line in return statement:
        Drawer.Screen name="place"
        Drawer.Screen name="total_transaction"

2. /(drawer_stud)/index.tsx:
    Pop is annoying, customer have to click one more time which ruins experience, so i commented it out:
    in function handleSelect():
        Alert.alert('Shop Details', `You selected ${shopDetails.shop_name}.`);

things left:
    1. fix git clone issue (Done)
    2. make amount route more robust, right now there are lots of issue related with staled state
    3. Implement transaction history route
    4. use React.memo in amount route
